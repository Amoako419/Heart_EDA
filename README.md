## Exploratory Data Analysis on a heart disease dataset
This project is a EDA on heart disease dataset, the dataset is located in the data folder.
The data contains information on heart health indicators, including demographic, clinical, 
and lifestyle variables.

The EDA is done in a jupyter notebook called eda.ipynb


In Task 3, the heart_disease column was edited to be in 0 and 1 
Where *0* = no heart disease
and *1* = heart disease 

This will make heart_disease column easy to analyze and draw conclusions.
